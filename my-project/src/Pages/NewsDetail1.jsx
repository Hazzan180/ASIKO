            The Walking Football, as the name indicates, follows the rules of conventional football except running. This type of football is slow-paced and aimed at increasing the physical activity of people above 50 for health purposes. The game allows former players or lovers of football to experience the joy of football without being limited by their health conditions.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray">
            The Walking football 1-day tournament, which held in Lagos last weekend in Surulere, was to prepare and raise a formidable team for the upcoming World Cup. The game saw the emergence of the Mangers All Stars football club as winners of the 4-team match.

          <p className="text-gray">
            As a company passionate about improving the health of Nigerians through the adoption of clean energy, we were happy to sponsor an initiative that contributes to the overall health, quality of life and wellbeing of people, through Lite Gas.
